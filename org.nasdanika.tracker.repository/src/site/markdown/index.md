# Nasdanika Shinobi Tracker

Nasdanika Tracker is an issue tracker for Maven projects - it assumes that deliverables (components, projects) are represented as Maven artifacts organized into groups and delivered in increments called versions.
The primary goal is to provide Java developers a tracking tool which requires minimal "mental stitching and switching" between Java/Maven and issue tracking prolem domains and ways of thinking.

The secondary goal to provide Java developers an open source extendable and customizable issue tracking solution.   

The tracker can be used as an eclipse plugin and in the future also as a web application. 

This product is in an early stage of development. The [vision](vision.html) document explains where development is intended to be headed.
